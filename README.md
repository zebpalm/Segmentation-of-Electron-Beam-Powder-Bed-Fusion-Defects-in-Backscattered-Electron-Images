# PBF-EB Defect Segmentation

This repository contains the Python scripts used in the thesis project *"Segmentation of Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion Defects in Backscattered Electron Images"* by Zeb Palm, at Mid Sweden University (Östersund).

The code is organized across different branches based on functionality:

- **`evaluation`** – Scripts for evaluating segmentation performance (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score).
- **`pore-segmentation`** – Algorithms for segmenting pores in BSE images.
- **`swelling-segmentation`** – Scripts focused on detecting swelling defects.
- **`Other`** – Additional utilities and supporting scripts.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own research or applications in additive manufacturing and image analysis.
